- Reflect on the feedback â€“ the survey reports reveal the learning conditions in each class and how they are changing.
- Three 1-hour meetings to discuss the survey results and decide on new practices to try in the classroom.
- As a faculty learning community, learn from each other and consult the classroom practices library to decide what new practices to try.
